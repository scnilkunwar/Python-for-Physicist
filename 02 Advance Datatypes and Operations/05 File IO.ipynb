    "## File I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, File I/O (Input/Output) allows programs to read from and write to files. It is an essential part of handling data in any application. Here’s a detailed explanation of how to handle file operations in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a File\n",
    "Python provides the built-in `open()` function to open files. It returns a file object, and its syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file_object = open(file_name, mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**file_name**: Name of the file (string) you want to open.\n",
    "\n",
    "**mode**: Mode in which you want to open the file. Common modes include:\n",
    "- 'r': Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading. Raises an error if the file doesn’t exist.\n",
    "- 'w': Write mode. Opens the file for writing. Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist or truncates the file if it exists.\n",
    "- 'a': Append mode. Opens the file for appending. Data is added at the end of the file.\n",
    "- 'x': Create mode. Creates a new file. Raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "- 'b': Binary mode. Used with other modes to handle binary files (e.g., 'rb', 'wb').\n",
    "- 't': Text mode (default). Used for handling text files. Can be combined with other modes (e.g., 'rt').\n",
    "### Closing a File\n",
    "After performing operations on a file, you should always close it to free up system resources. This is done using the `close()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file_object.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or you can use a with statement, which automatically handles closing the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'r') as file_object:\n",
    "    # Perform file operations\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Reading from a File\n",
    "- `read()`: Reads the entire content of the file.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "        print(content)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- `readline()`: Reads one line at a time.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "        line = file.readline()\n",
    "        print(line)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- `readlines()`: Reads all lines of a file and returns them as a list.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "        lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "        print(lines)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "### Writing to a File\n",
    "- `write()`: Writes a string to the file. If the file exists, it truncates (clears) the file before writing unless you're in append mode.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "        file.write(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- `writelines()`: Writes a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "        file.writelines(['Line 1\\n', 'Line 2\\n'])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "### Appending to a File\n",
    "You can append data to an existing file using 'a' mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'a') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"Appending new text.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Binary Mode\n",
    "To work with non-text files (e.g., images or PDFs), use binary mode ('b'):\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading a binary file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('image.png', 'rb') as file:\n",
    "    data = file.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Writing to a binary file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('new_image.png', 'wb') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### File Operations\n",
    "Python’s os and os.path modules provide useful functions to work with files and directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Check if a file exists:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "if os.path.exists('file.txt'):\n",
    "    print('File exists.')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('File does not exist.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Remove a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "os.remove('file.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Rename a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "os.rename('old_name.txt', 'new_name.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Seeking and Telling\n",
    "- `tell()`: Returns the current file position.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "        print(file.tell())  # Get the current position\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- `seek(offset, whence)`: Moves the file pointer to the desired location.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "        file.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the file\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "### Working with JSON and CSV Files\n",
    "**JSON:** The full form of JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application. Python provides the json module to work with JSON files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    import json\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Writing to JSON file\n",
    "    data = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "    with open('data.json', 'w') as file:\n",
    "        json.dump(data, file)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Reading from JSON file\n",
    "    with open('data.json', 'r') as file:\n",
    "        data = json.load(file)\n",
    "        print(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**CSV:** A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a plain text file that stores tabular data in a simple format where each line represents a row of data, and each value within the row is separated by a comma (or another delimiter like a semicolon or tab). Python provides the csv module to work with CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Writing to CSV file\n",
    "    with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:\n",
    "        writer = csv.writer(file)\n",
    "        writer.writerow(['Name', 'Age'])\n",
    "        writer.writerow(['Alice', 25])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Reading from CSV file\n",
    "    with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:\n",
    "        reader = csv.reader(file)\n",
    "        for row in reader:\n",
    "            print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Handling Errors with File I/O\n",
    "It’s good practice to handle potential errors using try-except blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "            content = file.read()\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "        print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "    except IOError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error reading or writing to the file.\")\n",
    "```"
