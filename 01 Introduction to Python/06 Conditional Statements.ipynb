    "#### Free Fall Calculation\n",
    "Write a program that takes the height (in meters) from which an object is dropped and calculates the time taken to reach the ground using the formula $t = \\sqrt \\frac{2h}{g}$, where ùëî is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s). Use conditional statements to print whether the time is less than, equal to, or greater than 3 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kinetic Energy Checker\n",
    "Create a program that takes the mass (in kg) and velocity (in m/s) of an object as input. Calculate the kinetic energy using the formula $K.E. = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 $. Use conditional statements to determine if the kinetic energy is low (less than 50 J), medium (between 50 J and 150 J), or high (greater than 150 J).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gas Law Calculator\n",
    "Write a program that prompts the user for the pressure (in atm), volume (in liters), and temperature (in Kelvin) of a gas. Use the ideal gas law $PV = nRT$ to calculate the number of moles ùëõ. Use conditional statements to categorize the amount of gas as \"Low\" (less than 1 mole), \"Moderate\" (1 to 10 moles), or \"High\" (more than 10 moles).\n",
